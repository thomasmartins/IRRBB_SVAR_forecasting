# Bayesian SVAR analysis for macroeconomic and IRRBB forecasting with Python

This repository contains a project of how to link Bayesian SVAR modeling to Basel III interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) metrics. The goal is to translate yield-curve and macroeconomic scenarios into consistent forecasts of bank-level Net Interest Income (NII) and Economic Value of Equity (EVE) responses using:

- A **Bayesian VAR (BVAR)** estimated in PyMC  
- **Sign-restricted SVAR** identification for monetary and fiscal shocks  
- **Basel III / ECB IRRBB standard rate shocks** (parallel, steepener, flattener, short-end)  
- **Conditional forecasts** under both structural and Basel scenarios  
- A stylised **NII and EVE** engine to illustrate the impact on bank earnings and economic value

The project is designed as a **research-style portfolio piece**: all the core logic lives in Python modules, while a single notebook (`MAIN_clean.ipynb`) walks through the full workflow and produces publication-ready figures.
